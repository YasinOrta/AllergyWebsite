              <p class="w3-text-grey" style="margin-top: 10px;"> drug allergy is the abnormal reaction of your immune system to a medication. Any medication — over-the-counter, 
                prescription or herbal — is capable of inducing a drug allergy. However, a drug allergy is more likely with certain medications.

                The most common signs and symptoms of drug allergy are hives, rash or fever. A drug allergy may cause serious reactions, 
                including a life-threatening condition that affects multiple body systems (anaphylaxis).
                
                A drug allergy is not the same as a drug side effect, a known possible reaction listed on a drug label. 
                A drug allergy is also different from drug toxicity caused by an overdose of medication.</p><br>
              <!--<h5>What Are the Signs of an Allergic Reaction Due to Drug Allergy?</h5>-->
            </div>

            <div id="Food" class="container menu padding-48 card">
              <p class="w3-text-grey" style="margin-top: 10px;">Food allergy is an immune system reaction that occurs soon after eating a certain food. 
                Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger signs and symptoms such as digestive problems, hives or swollen airways. 
                In some people, a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.

                Food allergy affects an estimated 8% of children under age 5 and up to 4% of adults. While there's no cure, 
                some children outgrow their food allergies as they get older.
                
                It's easy to confuse a food allergy with a much more common reaction known as food intolerance. While bothersome, 
                food intolerance is a less serious condition that does not involve the immune system.</p><br>
            </div>  

            <div id="Insect" class="container menu padding-48 card">
              <p class="w3-text-grey" style="margin-top: 10px;">Most people stung or bitten by insects suffer pain, redness, itching and minor swelling in the area 
                around the bite or sting. This is a normal reaction. Most people get better within hours or days.

                An allergic reaction to insects that don’t sting or bite, like cockroaches or dust mites, is different. 
                You may sneeze, cough, have a runny or stuffy nose, or itchy eyes, nose, mouth or throat. 
                These symptoms can be confused with the common cold, but last for weeks or months at a time. If you have asthma, 
                an allergic reaction could trigger asthma symptoms or an asthma attack.
                
                People can have a serious allergic reaction to stinging or biting insects. A life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) produces signs 
                and symptoms that require immediate medical attention. Without immediate treatment, anaphylaxis may cause death. Symptoms usually 
                involve more than one organ system (part of the body), such as the skin or mouth, the lungs, the heart, and the gut. Some symptoms include:
                
                Skin rashes, itching or hives
                Swelling of the lips, tongue or throat
                Shortness of breath, trouble breathing or wheezing (whistling sound during breathing)
                Dizziness and/or fainting
                Stomach pain, vomiting, bloating or diarrhea
                Feeling like something awful is about to happen
                Other serious but non-allergic reactions include:
                
                A toxic reaction that happens when the body reacts to insect venom like it is a poison. A toxic reaction can cause symptoms similar 
                to those of an allergic reaction. Other symptoms include nausea, fever, fainting, seizures, shock and even death.
                Serum sickness which is an unusual reaction to a foreign substance in the body. It can cause symptoms hours or days after the sting or bite. 
                Symptoms include fever, joint pain, other flu-like symptoms and sometimes hives.</p><br>
             </div>
        
              <div id="Latex" class="container menu padding-48 card">
                <p class="w3-text-grey" style="margin-top: 10px;">Latex allergy is a reaction to certain proteins found in natural rubber latex, 
                  a product made from the rubber tree. If you have a latex allergy, your body mistakes latex for a harmful substance.

                  Latex allergy may cause itchy skin and hives or even anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition that can cause throat swelling and 
                  severe difficulty breathing. Your doctor can determine if you have a latex allergy or if you're at risk of developing a latex allergy.
                  
                  Understanding latex allergy and knowing common sources of latex can help you prevent allergic reactions.</p><br>

              <div id="Mold" class="container menu padding-48 card">        
                <p class="w3-text-grey" style="margin-top: 10px;">If you have a mold allergy, your immune system overreacts when you breathe in mold spores. 
                  A mold allergy can cause coughing, itchy eyes and other symptoms that make you miserable. In some people, a mold allergy is linked to asthma and 
                  exposure causes restricted breathing and other airway symptoms.

                  If you have a mold allergy, the best defense is to reduce your exposure to the types of mold that cause your reaction. Medications can help keep 
                  mold allergy reactions under control.</p><br>           
                <!--<h5>Blueberry Pancakes</h5>-->
                <p class="w3-text-grey">A mold allergy causes the same signs and symptoms that occur in other types of upper respiratory allergies. 
                  Signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis caused by a mold allergy can include:

                  Sneezing
                  Runny or stuffy nose
                  Cough and postnasal drip
                  Itchy eyes, nose and throat
                  Watery eyes
                  Dry, scaly skin

                  Mold allergy symptoms vary from person to person and range from mild to severe. 
                  You might have year-round symptoms or symptoms that flare up only during certain times of the year. 
                  You might notice symptoms when the weather is damp or when you're in indoor or outdoor spaces that have high concentrations of mold.</p>
              </div>
        
              <div id="Pet" class="container menu padding-48 card">
                <p class="w3-text-grey" style="margin-top: 10px;">Pet allergy is an allergic reaction to proteins found in an animal's skin cells, saliva or urine. 
                  Signs of pet allergy include those common to hay fever, such as sneezing and runny nose. Some people may also experience signs of asthma, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing.

                  Most often, pet allergy is triggered by exposure to the dead flakes of skin (dander) a pet sheds. Any animal with fur can be a source of pet allergy, 
                  but pet allergies are most commonly associated with cats and dogs.
                  
                  If you have a pet allergy, the best strategy is to avoid or reduce exposure to the animal as much as possible. Medications or other treatments may be 
                  necessary to relieve symptoms and manage asthma.</p><br>
              </div>
        
              <div id="Pollen" class="container menu padding-48 card">   
                <p class="text-grey" style="margin-top: 10px;">Climate change will potentially lead to both higher pollen concentrations and longer pollen seasons, 
                  causing more people to suffer more health effects from pollen and other allergens.

                  Pollen is an airborne allergen that can affect our health. Pollen grains are tiny “seeds” dispersed from flowering plants, trees, grass, and weeds. 
                  The amount and type of pollen in the air depends on the season and geographic region. Though pollen counts are typically higher during the warmer seasons, 
                  some plants pollinate year-round.</p><br>
                <!--<h5>Blueberry Pancakes</h5>-->
                <p class="text-grey">Climate change will potentially lead to shifts in precipitation patterns, more frost-free days, warmer seasonal air temperatures, 
                  and more carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. These changes can affect:

                  when the pollen season starts and ends and how long it lasts each year,
                  how much pollen plants create and how much is in the air,
                  how pollen affects our health (the “allergenicity” of pollen),
                  how much pollen we’re exposed to, and
                  our risk of experiencing allergy symptoms.

                  Pollen exposure can trigger various allergic reactions, including symptoms of hay fever. Hay fever, also known as allergic rhinitis, 
                  occurs when allergens like pollen enter your body and your immune system mistakenly identifies them as a threat. 
                  If you have allergic rhinitis, your body then responds to the allergen by releasing chemicals that can cause symptoms in the nose. 
                  Symptoms of allergic rhinitis can occur during certain seasons or year-round, depending on the allergen, and affect as many as 60 million 
                  people per year in the United States. Symptoms from allergic rhinitis include sneezing, runny nose, and congestion.
                  
                  Pollen exposure can also trigger symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the lining of 
                  the eye (conjunctiva) due to exposure to allergens like those in pollen. Allergic conjunctivitis is found in up to 30% of the general 
                  population and as many as 7 out of 10 of patients with allergic rhinitis. Symptoms from allergic conjunctivitis include red, watery, or itchy eyes.
                  
                  People with respiratory illnesses like asthma may be more sensitive to pollen. Exposure to pollen has been linked to asthma attacks 
                  and increases in hospital admissions for respiratory illness. Medical costs linked with pollen exceed $3 billion every year, with nearly
                   half of those costs being linked to prescription medicine. Higher pollen concentrations and longer pollen seasons can also make you more 
                   sensitive to allergens. This can trigger asthma episodes in individuals with asthma and diminish productive work and school days.
                  
                  Extreme rainfall and rising temperatures also can contribute to indoor air quality problems. For example, they can cause the growth of 
                  mold indoors, which may lead to worsened respiratory conditions for people with asthma and/or mold allergies and heightened challenges in 
                  maintaining adequate asthma control.</p>
